/**
 * `PersistedRecord` union and the `RecordLog` interface — spec §11.1–§11.5.
 *
 * Every record the host appends to its `run_id`-keyed append-only log is
 * a member of `PersistedRecord`. The union covers:
 *
 *  - §11.2 `transition_accepted`
 *  - §11.3 `transition_rejected`
 *  - §11.4 `session_started` / `session_ended` / `session_failed`
 *  - §11.5 `model_fallback`
 *  - §11.1 `checkpoint_snapshot` (the wrapper around the full `Checkpoint`
 *    the host appends after every accepted/rejected transition so
 *    `latestCheckpoint(runId)` is a read of the last snapshot, not an
 *    event-sourced replay — §11.1 explicitly forbids replay).
 *  - `run_seeded` (host-owned, non-machine-event record carrying the
 *    run's original goal at `startRun` time; used by `resumeRun` to
 *    restore the goal context).
 *
 * **`RecordLog`** is the host-side persistence contract. The pure core
 * ships the interface and an in-memory implementation for unit tests.
 * The Phase 4 host driver owns the file-backed implementation
 * (append-only JSONL keyed by `run_id`; no SDK branch scoping, §11.1).
 *
 * Host-agnostic. No pi imports, no real I/O.
