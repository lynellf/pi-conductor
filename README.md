## What this is

pi-conductor orchestrates multi-role LLM workflows as a deterministic
**hub-and-spoke** state machine: one orchestrator role dispatches to one or more
worker roles, every transition is validated against a pinned manifest snapshot,
every state change is reduced through a pure reducer, and every record is
appended to a run-keyed log. Caps (per-session, per-run, per-worker visit count)
are enforced as host guards that synthesize machine events through the reducer —
never by mutating the checkpoint.

It ships as a [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) package:

```bash
pi install ./           # from this checkout (dev)
# or, once published:
pi install npm:pi-conductor
pi install git:github.com/lynellf/pi-conductor
```

After install, four slash commands are available inside any pi session:

```text
/conduct <goal>          Start a run for <goal> using .pi/conductor.yaml
/conduct:resume <run_id> Resume a previously-started run by run_id
/conduct:list            List known runs in the conductor log
/conduct:abort           Abort the active run
```

Plus a flag:

```text
--conduct-manifest <path>  Override the default manifest path
```

A thin CLI fallback (`bin/conduct`) also ships, for non-pi consumers and
scripted runs:

```bash
node dist/bin/conduct.js .pi/conductor.yaml "ship the changelog"
```

The engine is the same in all three surfaces — extension, CLI, and library.

---

## Two layers, kept strictly apart

- **Pure core** (`src/core`, `src/manifest`, `src/seam`, `src/cost`,
  `src/persistence`) — the deterministic FSM reducer + manifest static checks +
  TypeBox emission schemas + cost roll-up. **Zero pi imports.** Enforced by a
  grep-guard test that scans source as text.
- **SDK host driver** (`src/host`) — owns the orchestration loop, spawns role
  sessions via `createAgentSession`, persists records, enforces caps. **The only
  place that imports `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`.**

The extension layer (`extensions/conduct.ts` + `src/extension/`) is the UX shell
that wraps the engine. It does not become the engine: worker role sessions are
still spawned by the production `Host` via the standalone `createAgentSession`,
not via `ctx.newSession()` / `ctx.fork()`. A grep guard on `extensions/**/*.ts`
rejects those two calls — the §9.5 boundary holds. While a conduct run is
active in the TUI, press `Esc` and confirm to abort it; the standalone `conduct`
CLI does not add that Escape interrupt.

For the full architecture rationale, see
[`docs/orchestrator-fsm-spec.md`](docs/orchestrator-fsm-spec.md) (the
authority).

## Quick start

### 1. Install

```bash
pi install ./                       # from the checkout, dev install
pi list                             # verify: pi-conductor should appear
```

### 2. Declare roles

Roles live in a single YAML manifest, `.pi/conductor.yaml`. The repo ships an
example:

```yaml
version: 1
roles:
  - name: orchestrator
    is_orchestrator: true
    models: [anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5]
    max_run_cost_usd: 25.0
    system_prompt: .pi/roles/orchestrator.md
    tools: [read, bash, handoff, end]

  - name: implementer
    max_visits: 3
    max_session_cost_usd: 5.0
    models: [anthropic:claude-opus-4-5, openai:gpt-4o] # primary + fallbacks
    system_prompt: .pi/roles/implementer.md
    tools: [read, edit, write, bash, handoff, end]

  - name: reviewer
    max_visits: 3
    system_prompt: .pi/roles/reviewer.md
    tools: [read, grep, handoff, end]
```

### 3. Write role prompts

Each role's system prompt is a plain-prose `.md` file at the declared
`system_prompt` path. The host loads it via
`DefaultResourceLoader({ systemPromptOverride })` and feeds it to the role's
session. See the shipped defaults at
`tests/fixtures/default-conductor/.pi/roles/`. A role prompt tells the role
which tools it has (`handoff`, and — for the orchestrator only — `end`), what
its legal handoff targets are, and when to end.

A minimal starter bundle is available programmatically:

```ts
import { getDefaultBundle } from "pi-conductor";
const { yaml, prompts } = getDefaultBundle(); // default conductor.yaml + orchestrator/worker prompts
```

### 4. Run

Inside any pi session in a project with `.pi/conductor.yaml`:

```text
/conduct ship the changelog for the auth refactor
```

You'll see the conductor's status line update as the orchestrator dispatches to
workers; while a role session is active, the footer may also show
`model=<provider:id>` or `model=<default>` for the current worker. The run
reaches a terminal state and notifies with the run_id, and `/conduct:list` shows
the same model token for active runs. While the run is active, `Esc` opens a
confirmation dialog; confirming aborts the run just like `/conduct:abort`.

### `RoleConfig` fields

| Field                  | Applies to        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `is_orchestrator`      | exactly one role  | Marks the hub. Workers hand back to it; only it may emit `end`.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `models`               | any role          | Ordered `[primary, ...fallbacks]`, each `provider:id`. Bare aliases are rejected (§13). Fallbacks are tried on `session_failed(model_error)`.                                                                                                             |
| `max_session_cost_usd` | any role          | Per-invocation cap, **shared across model fallbacks** within that invocation (§8.1, §11.7).                                                                                                                                                               |
| `max_run_cost_usd`     | orchestrator only | Run-level cap. Rejected on workers (§13).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `system_prompt`        | any role          | Path to a per-role system-prompt file the host loads. Plain prose, not frontmatter.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `tools`                | any role          | Declared tool allowlist. `handoff` and `end` are **force-injected by the host regardless**; omitting them emits a §13 warning. See [Tools available to roles](#tools-available-to-roles) below for the full tool model and the `tools:`-omission footgun. |

`version` is a human-bumped integer, **pinned at run-start and never mutated
mid-run** (spec §10). `resumeRun` rejects a manifest whose version disagrees
with the snapshot's pinned version.

### Tools available to roles

Each role session gets tools from **two sources**, and the manifest's `tools:`
field is an **explicit allowlist**, not an extension of pi's defaults:

**1. Conductor-defined machine-event tools — always on, force-injected.**

`handoff` and `end` are defined by pi-conductor (TypeBox schemas in `src/seam/`,
factories in `src/host/tools.ts`) and registered as `customTools` on every role
session. They are added to the allowlist **regardless of what `tools:`
declares** (§8.1); omitting them from `tools:` emits a §13 warning but does not
disable them.

- **`handoff`** — terminate this role's session and route to another declared
  role. Workers may only hand off to the orchestrator; the orchestrator may hand
  off to any declared worker (subject to visit caps, §7.3). Args:
  `target_role: Role` (required, non-empty), plus optional `reason: string` and
  `suggests_next: Role` (workers only, non-binding — the orchestrator still
  emits its own legal handoff).
- **`end`** — terminate this role's session and declare the run complete. Legal
  only from the orchestrator (§7.2); a worker calling `end` produces a
  `transition_rejected` record with `legal_targets` surfaced. Args: optional
  `reason: string`.

Both tools only **validate and record intent** into a per-session capture buffer
and return a terminating message; they do **not** call `reduce` and do **not**
persist — the loop owns those exclusively (§12.1). After a role's first valid
`handoff`/`end` capture, the session is **sealed**: every other tool
short-circuits, so work-after-handoff cannot mutate the workspace.

**2. Built-in + custom tools — pass-through to pi's tool registry.**

Every other name in `tools:` is resolved by pi's SDK, not pi-conductor.
pi-conductor does not construct or restrict these — it passes the declared names
straight through to `createAgentSession({ tools: [...] })`.

pi's built-in tool set (the authoritative reference is **pi's own
documentation** — see the links below; pi-conductor does not redefine it) is, as
of pi 0.79.x:

- **On by default (4):** `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`.
- **Additional built-in read-only tools, opt-in via `tools:` (3):** `grep`,
  `find`, `ls`.

Extension-registered or custom tool names the host pi session makes available
may also be named in `tools:`.

> **Note the interaction with the `tools:`-allowlist footgun below:** because
> pi-conductor treats `tools:` as an explicit allowlist (not an extension of
> pi's defaults), a role that wants the standard file/shell access must **name**
> `read`/`write`/`edit`/`bash` explicitly — they are not inherited just because
> pi enables them by default in a plain `pi` session. `grep`/`find`/`ls`
> likewise must be named to be available.

**Reference — pi's tool documentation (the authority on the built-in set;
pi-conductor is a pass-through consumer):**

- [pi Quickstart — tools](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md)
  (the "By default, pi gives the model four tools" statement + the opt-in
  read-only tools).
- [pi SDK reference — tools](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/blob/main/docs/sdk.md)
  (the `createReadTool` / `createWriteTool` / `createEditTool` /
  `createBashTool` / `createGrepTool` / `createFindTool` / `createLsTool`
  factories, the `tools` / `excludeTools` / `noTools` options, and custom-tool
  registration via `customTools` / `pi.registerTool`).

If those links 404 (pi's repo may be a monorepo at `earendil-works/pi` under
`packages/coding-agent/docs/`), the same files ship inside the installed
`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` package at `docs/quickstart.md` and
`docs/sdk.md`.

**Footgun — `tools:` is an explicit allowlist, not a default-extension.** A role
receives **exactly** the names it declares plus `handoff`+`end` — not pi's
four-tool default (`read`/`write`/`edit`/`bash`) on top. **Omitting `tools:`
entirely gives the role only `handoff`+`end`** — no file or shell access, and no
§13 warning fires (the §13 check only triggers when `tools:` is present but
missing `handoff`/`end`). Such a role can emit machine events but cannot do
work. Declare every tool a role actually needs.

## Advanced: library use

The pure FSM core + SDK host driver are importable as a library. The public API:

```ts
import {
  startRun,
  resumeRun,
  listRuns,
  createProductionHost,
  type Host,
  type HostFactoryContext,
  getDefaultBundle,
} from "pi-conductor";

const handle = await startRun(".pi/conductor.yaml", {
  goal: "Ship a changelog for the auth refactor.",
  hostFactory: (ctx: HostFactoryContext) =>
    createProductionHost({
      extension: { modelRegistry: /* pi's ModelRegistry */, cwd: process.cwd() },
      run: { log: ctx.log, loadedManifest: ctx.loadedManifest, runId: ctx.runId },
    }),
});

const { finalCheckpoint, exitReason } = await handle.completion();
```

`Host` is the seam between the pure loop and the pi SDK. It owns session
creation, event subscription + usage accumulation, the run-keyed log, and
per-session state. You can also implement a custom `Host` against the interface
in `src/host/host.ts` (six methods: `spawnRole`, `captureUsage`,
`persistRecord`, `seedRunMemory`, `abortSession`, `sealSession`, plus
`nextVisitIndex`, `sessionTerminalReason`, `getNextModel`, `runCostSoFar`).

The CLI is a thin example of this: `src/bin/conduct.ts` calls `startRun` with a
`hostFactory` that builds a `ProductionHost` from a fresh `ModelRegistry`. Read
it for a self-contained 100-line integration example.

## Architecture in brief

```
checkpoint + event + def (pinned manifest snapshot)
            │
            ▼
        reduce()  ── pure, deterministic, host-agnostic (src/core)
            │
            ▼
   transition record + new checkpoint
            │
            ▼
   host persists record + snapshot, spawns next role (src/host)
            │
            ▼
   ┌────────┴────────┐
   ▼                 ▼
   bin/conduct    extensions/conduct.ts
   (CLI)          (pi extension /commands)
```

- **`def: MachineDefinition`** is the pinned manifest snapshot. `reduce` /
  `reduceLifecycle` are pure functions of `(checkpoint,
  event, def, meta)` —
  no ambient config, no I/O. `meta.role ===
  checkpoint.current_role` is
  asserted inside `reduce`; a mismatch is thrown, not trusted.
- **Every state change goes through `reduce`.** Cost-cap forced-close
  synthesizes a machine `end` event fed to `reduce`; the checkpoint is never
  mutated to `done` directly.
- **Checkpoint is snapshot-appended, never mutated in place.** Resume reads the
  latest snapshot from the host-owned `run_id`-keyed log. SDK branch scoping is
  not used.
- **`handoff`/`end` tools only validate + record intent** into a capture buffer
  and return a terminating message; they do **not** call `reduce` and do **not**
  persist. The loop owns `reduce` + persistence + spawning.
- **Post-emission sealing:** once a role's first valid `handoff`/`end` capture
  is recorded, the session is sealed — wrapped tools refuse to execute, so
  work-after-handoff cannot mutate the workspace.

## Contributing

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 22.19.0, pnpm (matches the pi ecosystem). No npm/yarn.
- Install: `pnpm install` (also installs Lefthook git hooks via an allowlisted
  postinstall).

### Verification commands

```bash
pnpm typecheck        # tsc --noEmit (strict + noUncheckedIndexedAccess), incl. tests
pnpm build            # emits dist/ with .d.ts
pnpm test             # vitest run (incl. the grep-guard test)
pnpm lint             # biome check .  (lint + format check)
pnpm format:check     # biome format .
pnpm audit --prod     # supply-chain audit
```

`pre-push` (Lefthook) runs `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`
sequentially; any failure blocks the push. CI runs the same three directly.

### Invariants you must not break

- **No pi imports in the core.** `src/core`, `src/manifest`, `src/seam`,
  `src/cost`, `src/persistence` must not import
  `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. `tests/grep-guard.test.ts` scans source as
  text and will fail `pnpm test` (and the pre-push hook) on a violation — a TS
  error can never mask it. `src/host`, `src/extension`, and `extensions/` may
  import pi (they're the only layers that bridge to the SDK). If you reach for
  the SDK in the core, stop; that code belongs in `src/host`.
- **Reducer purity.** `reduce` / `reduceLifecycle` take `def` and read roles +
  caps only from it — never from imports or globals.
- **One schema, TypeBox.** No Zod. The `handoff`/`end` TypeBox schemas are the
  single source of truth for tool args, seam validation, and the derived TS
  type. The peer-dependency declaration for `typebox` in `package.json` matches
  the name pi bundles — don't swap back to `@sinclair/typebox` (different
  package, would break tool-arg validation at runtime).
- **TypeScript strict**, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, ESM + NodeNext. No
  `any`. Named exports only.
- **Module size ~400 LOC ceiling.** Split by responsibility before a file gets
  large. Readability over cleverness.
- **No silent fallbacks.** Ambiguity → throw a typed error or surface a warning.
- **No `ctx.newSession()` / `ctx.fork` in `extensions/`.** Role sessions are
  spawned via the standalone `createAgentSession` only.
  `tests/extension/no-role-spawn-via-session-tree.test.ts` greps for these
  calls.

### Phases gate each other

Work is sequenced in phases; don't start the next phase until the current one is
green and its plan checkboxes are ticked. Per-phase human review is not a gate —
the overseer reviews specs up front and gives feedback at the end of the loop
(see _Operating model_ in `AGENTS.md`). Touch only what your task asks for;
surface assumptions before implementing; if a task is non-trivial and no spec
exists, write one. See `AGENTS.md` for the full working agreement.

### Supply chain (pnpm)

Project config lives in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (camelCase keys, pnpm 10
canonical). Hardening: `minimumReleaseAge: 10080` (only versions ≥ 7 days old),
`strictDepBuilds: true` (build scripts must be allowlisted under
`onlyBuiltDependencies`), `excludeLinksFromLockfile: true`. `pnpm-lock.yaml` is
committed; CI installs with `--frozen-lockfile`. Never set
`dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds`; adding a dep with a build script requires an
allowlist entry with a one-line justification.
